1. Maximum Workload Policy 
o Maximum workload per professor is 12 hours per week. 
o Faculty should not exceed their department-defined weekly limit. 
2. Daily Workload Policy 
o No faculty should teach more than 4 hours per day (configurable). 
o Excess daily hours are considered rule violations. 
3. Consecutive Hours Policy 
o No faculty should have more than 3 consecutive teaching hours. 
o After 3 continuous hours, a break is mandatory. 
4. Break/Gap Policy 
o Faculty should have at least one free slot between two sessions. 
o Back-to-back classes are discouraged unless specified by department. 
5. Availability Constraints 
o Faculty must not be scheduled during their unavailable slots. 
o Special duties such as meetings, TnP sessions, and exam duties must be 
respected. 
6. Room/Infrastructure Policies 
o No two classes should be assigned to the same room at overlapping times. 
o Labs must be scheduled only in lab rooms, theory classes only in theory 
rooms. 
o Room capacity must match or exceed the batch strength. 
o Lab sessions may require contiguous slots. 
7. Clash Prevention Rules 
o A clash occurs when: 
a. Same faculty is assigned to overlapping sessions. 
b. Same room is assigned for overlapping sessions. 
c. A faculty is scheduled during an unavailable slot. 
d. Faculty exceeds max daily or weekly hours. 
o Hard clashes must be automatically rejected. 
o Soft clashes can be suggested for adjustment with alternatives. 
8. Scheduling Constraints 
o Respect the academic calendar, blocked weeks, and meeting hours. 
o Practical (lab) sessions may require 2–3 continuous slots. 
o Theory subjects typically require weekly 3–4 hours. 
o Timetable must balance load across the week (avoid overloaded days). 
9. Fairness & Load Distribution 
o All faculty within a department should get a fair distribution of hours. 
o Avoid giving one faculty many early-morning or late-afternoon slots 
consistently. 
o Workload summaries must highlight imbalance. 
10. Data Requirements for Scheduling 
o Faculty profiles (name, department, weekly hours). 
o Courses handled and hours/week. 
o Rooms/labs with type and capacity. 
o Timeslots with day & hour. 
o Academic calendar (holidays, exam weeks). 
o Department-specific rules. 
11. Timetable Adjustment Principles 
o Any adjustment should try the following in order: 
a. Move the session to the nearest free slot 
b. Swap with another faculty’s slot (if qualified) 
c. Change room to a free room 
d. Suggest merging/splitting sessions (if allowed) 
o Adjustments must minimize disruptions and maintain fairness. 
12. Reporting & Auditing Requirements 
o Weekly workload summary per professor. 
o Department-level KPIs: 
 Total hours 
 Theory vs practical split 
 Busiest day 
 Room utilization 
o Highlight rule violations (daily, weekly, consecutive hours). 
o Export reports in CSV/PDF/iCal formats. 
13. Scope of Scheduling 
o UG/PG in-department timetables. 
o Theory & practical classes. 
o Institutional constraints and TnP slots. 
o Input sources can include CSV/Excel/Database. 
o Must support “what-if” edits and manual overrides. 
14. General Timetable Guidelines 
o Avoid clustering multiple tough subjects on the same day. 
o Distribute classes evenly throughout the week. 
o Prioritize faculty preferences if they do not violate rules. 
o Ensure no duplication of faculty or room assignments. 
o Maintain consistency (same class slot weekly, where possible).
